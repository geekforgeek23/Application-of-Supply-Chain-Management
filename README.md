# Application-of-Supply-Chain-Management
In this research project, I contributed extensively to exploring the application of Machine Learning (ML) in Supply Chain Management (SCM). My role focused on data preprocessing, cleaning, and performing in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights related to customer sales, delivery performance, and profitability. I was actively involved in creating visualizations such as histograms, box plots, KDE curves, scatter plots, and heatmaps to interpret patterns in customer behavior and sales trends. Additionally, I participated in building and evaluating machine learning models, including linear regression for sales forecasting and logistic regression for predicting delivery outcomes. This hands-on experience allowed me to connect theoretical ML techniques with real-world SCM challenges, such as demand forecasting, delivery delays, and inventory optimization, helping businesses make data-driven decisions more effectively.
